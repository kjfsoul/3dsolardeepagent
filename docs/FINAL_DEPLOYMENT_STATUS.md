## ⚠️ Important Clarification

### Two Separate Domains:

1. **tracker.3iatlas.mysticarcana.com** ← This repo (3dsolardeepagent)
2. **3iatlas.mysticarcana.com** ← Different project (3iatlas repo)

**These are TWO DIFFERENT sites.**

---

## 🤔 What You Want

You mentioned: "3iatlas.mysticarcana.com should use this tracker"

If you want the MAIN domain (without "tracker" subdomain) to show the tracker:

### Option 1: Add Domain to Same Project
```bash
# This would require Vercel dashboard access to add domain to frontend project
```

### Option  Nexus connect tracker to 3iatlas repo structure?

---

## 📋 Current Architecture

```
3dsolardeepagent (GitHub repo)
    ↓
frontend (Vercel project)
    ↓
tracker.3iatlas.mysticarcana.com ✅

VS

3iatlas (Different GitHub repo?)
    ↓
? (Different Vercel project?)
    ↓
3iatlas.mysticarcana.com
```

**Question:** Should `3iatlas.mysticarcana.com` ALSO show the tracker content?

If YES, you need to either:
1. Point that domain to the `frontend` project as well
2. Or configure the 3iatlas repo to embed/import this tracker

---

## ✅ What's Working Now

- `tracker.3iatlas.mysticarcana.com` ← **LIVE and updated from this repo**
- Vercel `frontend` project connected to GitHub repo `3dsolardeepagent`
- Auto-deploys when pushing to `main` branch
- Manual deploys work with `vercel --prod`

---

## 🎯 Next Steps to Fix

If you want `3iatlas.mysticarcana.com` to also update from this tracker:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
2. **Open `frontend` project settings**
3. **Add `3iatlas.mysticarcana.com` as additional domain/alias**
4. **OR** - Check if there's a separate project managing that domain

The CLI linked the repo to the project, but domain aliasing for multiple domains needs to be done in the Vercel dashboard.
