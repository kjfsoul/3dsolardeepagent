# DEPLOYMENT FIX - tracker.3iatlas.mysticarcana.com

## Date: October 29, 2025, 1:23 AM EDT

## Problem

The `tracker.3iatlas.mysticarcana.com` domain was connected to Vercel project `frontend`, but that project was deploying from the wrong repository (`3iatlas` repo instead of `3dsolardeepagent`).

## Solution

1. Linked `frontend` Vercel project to `3dsolardeepagent` repository
2. Deployed production build from current repo state
3. Verified alias connection to `tracker.3iatlas.mysticarcana.com`

## Deployment Details

**Vercel Project:** `kjfsouls-projects/frontend`  
**Repository:** `3dsolardeepagent` (now correctly linked)  
**Production URL:** https://tracker.3iatlas.mysticarcana.com  
**Deployment ID:** `dpl_7DcPw3qB9BMphjsub2GvTsK2GVcE`  
**Status:** ● Ready  
**Build Time:** ~1 minute  

## Commands Used

```bash
cd /Users/kfitz/3dsolardeepagent
vercel link --project frontend --yes
vercel --prod
```

## Verification

Deployment aliases confirmed:
- ✅ `https://tracker.3iatlas.mysticarcana.com` (production)
- ✅ `https://frontend-kjfsouls-projects.vercel.app`
- ✅ `https://frontend-nine-opal-vdhbvbqdxd.vercel.app`

## Current State

**tracker.3iatlas.mysticarcana.com now deploys from:**
- **Repository:** `3dsolardeepagent`
- **Branch:** `main` (auto-deploys)
- **Build Config:** From `vercel.json` at repo root

All fixes from `feature/instructions-fixes` branch should now appear on the live tracker site.

---

**Note:** The `main` branch merge had conflicts, so production is currently based on the feature branch state before the merge attempt. User may need to manually resolve and push to main for automatic updates in the future.
