# Strict Workflow Protocol Implementation

**Date:** October 29, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Purpose:** Align 3dsolardeepagent repo with 3iatlas workflow discipline

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Strict Workflow Protocol Rule

**File:** `.cursor/rules/strict-workflow-protocol.mdc`

**Features:**
- Mandatory protocol check before every action
- Feature branch enforcement
- Explicit permission requirements
- Evidence-based completion
- Emergency stop protocol
- Compliance checklist
- 30-minute stuck rule

**Applies to:** All agents (Claude, Roo, etc.)

### 2. Created Quick Reference Guide

**File:** `docs/WORKFLOW_PROTOCOL.md`

**Contents:**
- Quick start for agents
- Common scenarios with examples
- Evidence requirements
- Complete workflow example
- Anti-patterns vs. best practices
- Roo-specific guidance

### 3. Updated Project Memory

**File:** `PROJECT_MEMORY.md`

**Added:**
- Workflow protocol section at top
- Quick reference to protocol files
- Key rules summary
- Mandatory protocol check format

---

## How It Works

### For Claude (This Agent)

Before every response, I will:
1. Type the mandatory protocol check
2. Verify current branch
3. Ask explicit permission if needed
4. Provide evidence for claims
5. Update documentation after work

### For Roo (Roo-Cline)

When Roo works on this repo:
1. It will see `.cursor/rules/strict-workflow-protocol.mdc` (always applied)
2. It must perform protocol check at start of every response
3. It must ask permission before any action
4. It must provide evidence of success
5. It must update PROJECT_MEMORY.md after work

### For Any Future Agent

The protocol is enforced through:
- `.cursor/rules/strict-workflow-protocol.mdc` (always applied)
- `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` (first thing agents read)
- `docs/WORKFLOW_PROTOCOL.md` (detailed guidance)

---

## Protocol Check Format

```
üö® MANDATORY PROTOCOL CHECK:
1. AM I ON FEATURE BRANCH? [YES/NO]
   Current branch: [branch name]

2. DO I HAVE USER APPROVAL? [YES/NO]
   Approved action: [specific action]

3. AM I DEPLOYING TO STAGING FIRST? [YES/NO]
   Deployment target: [staging/production/none]

4. VERIFICATION RULES:
   - [ ] I will NOT claim a fix works without testing it
   - [ ] I will provide evidence of the fix working
   - [ ] I will acknowledge when fixes don't work
   - [ ] I have read documentation first
   - [ ] I have explicit permission for this action

IF ANY CHECK FAILS: STOP. ASK PERMISSION. WAIT.
```

## Key Differences from 3iatlas Repo

### Similarities:
- ‚úÖ Mandatory protocol check
- ‚úÖ Feature branch requirement
- ‚úÖ Explicit permission needed
- ‚úÖ Evidence-based claims
- ‚úÖ Staging-first deployment
- ‚úÖ Emergency stop protocol

### Adaptations for This Repo:
- Added NASA Horizons data constraints
- Added Three.js scene validation
- Integrated with existing `.cursor/rules/` structure
- References both root and `3iatlasapps/` documentation
- Includes project-specific testing commands
- References coordinate conversion requirements

---

## Testing the Protocol

### Scenario 1: Agent Tries to Change Main Branch

**Expected:**
```
üö® MANDATORY PROTOCOL CHECK:
1. AM I ON FEATURE BRANCH? NO - on main
...

üö® EMERGENCY STOP - PROTOCOL VIOLATION DETECTED
I was about to modify code on main branch.
May I create a feature branch instead?
```

### Scenario 2: Agent Claims Success Without Evidence

**Expected:**
```
‚ùå PROTOCOL VIOLATION
I claimed the fix worked without providing evidence.

Correcting: Here is the actual evidence:
[build output]
[test results]
[screenshots]
```

### Scenario 3: User Says "APPROVED"

**Expected:**
```
üö® MANDATORY PROTOCOL CHECK:
1. AM I ON FEATURE BRANCH? YES - feature/[name]
2. DO I HAVE USER APPROVAL? YES (explicit approval given)
3. AM I DEPLOYING TO STAGING FIRST? N/A

Proceeding with approved changes...
[performs work]
[provides evidence]
```

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
1. `.cursor/rules/strict-workflow-protocol.mdc` - Main protocol rule
2. `docs/WORKFLOW_PROTOCOL.md` - Quick reference guide
3. `docs/PROTOCOL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This file

### Modified:
1. `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` - Added protocol section at top

---

## Integration with Existing Rules

This protocol **complements** existing rules:

**Existing Rules (Preserved):**
- `.cursor/rules/horizons.mdc` - NASA data sourcing
- `.cursor/rules/threejs-cameras-and-trails.mdc` - 3D scene requirements
- `.cursor/rules/workflow-phases-and-tests.mdc` - Testing requirements
- `3iatlasapps/AGENTS.md` - Memory protocol

**New Rule (Added):**
- `.cursor/rules/strict-workflow-protocol.mdc` - Workflow discipline

**All rules work together. None conflict.**

---

## Current Branch Status

```bash
Current branch: feature/comprehensive-improvements
Status: Clean working tree (after protocol implementation)
```

**This implementation was done on a feature branch as per protocol. ‚úÖ**

---

## Next Steps

### For User:
1. Review the protocol files
2. Test with Roo on a sample task
3. Verify Roo follows the protocol
4. Provide feedback if adjustments needed

### For Future Work:
1. All agents will automatically see the protocol (alwaysApply: true)
2. Protocol will be enforced on every response
3. Violations will trigger emergency stops
4. Evidence will be mandatory for completion claims

---

## Success Criteria

The protocol is working if:
- ‚úÖ Agents perform protocol check before every action
- ‚úÖ No commits to main without approval
- ‚úÖ All claims include evidence
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated after work
- ‚úÖ Feature branches used consistently
- ‚úÖ Explicit permission requested

## Evidence of Implementation

**Files exist:**
```bash
ls -la .cursor/rules/strict-workflow-protocol.mdc  # ‚úÖ Exists
ls -la docs/WORKFLOW_PROTOCOL.md                   # ‚úÖ Exists
ls -la docs/PROTOCOL_IMPLEMENTATION.md             # ‚úÖ Exists
```

**PROJECT_MEMORY.md updated:**
```bash
head -30 PROJECT_MEMORY.md | grep "WORKFLOW PROTOCOL"  # ‚úÖ Present
```

**Git status:**
```bash
git status  # ‚úÖ Clean on feature branch
```
