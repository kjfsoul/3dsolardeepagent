# ByteRover MCP - NOT USED

**STATUS: DISABLED for 3I/ATLAS project**

## Why Disabled

During intensive development on the 3I/ATLAS project (Jan 2025), ByteRover MCP tools failed:
- `byterover-store-knowledge` calls appeared to succeed but data not retrievable
- `byterover-retrieve-knowledge` failed to return stored context
- Required re-explaining same concepts across multiple sessions
- Added overhead without demonstrated benefit
- No evidence of persistent knowledge accumulation

## Time Lost

~2 hours spent calling ByteRover tools with no benefit.
Context had to be re-explained manually each session anyway.

## What Works Instead

**Use local markdown files:**
- `/docs/PROJECT_MEMORY.md` - Always available, always accurate
- `/docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` - Real-time status
- `/docs/[TASK]_TASKS.md` - Step-by-step fixes
- Git commit history - Permanent record
- Inline code comments - Context where needed

## For Other Projects

ByteRover MCP may work fine on other projects.
This specific project had issues with it.

**Before using on a new project:**
1. Test storage/retrieval on simple task
2. Verify knowledge actually persists
3. Verify knowledge can be retrieved
4. Compare to local file approach
5. Use what works better

## Conclusion

**For 3I/ATLAS: Use local files, not ByteRover MCP.**

See `/Users/kfitz/3iatlas/.cursor/rules/00-project-core.mdc` for the working memory system.
