## Memory Updates

### 2025-01-20 23:15:00 - Fixed Comet Visibility and Ride-Along Camera Issues
**Files touched:** 
- `code_artifacts/3iatlas-flight-tracker/frontend/src/components/Comet3D.tsx`
- `code_artifacts/3iatlas-flight-tracker/frontend/src/components/Atlas3DTrackerEnhanced.tsx`

**What changed:** Fixed critical comet visibility and camera issues

**Why:** User reported double cone rendering and comet getting lost under Sun in "Ride With ATLAS" mode

**Validation results:**
- ✅ Fixed double cone issue: now single unified comet body
- ✅ Enhanced comet scale in Ride With ATLAS mode (6x larger: 0.3x vs 0.05x)
- ✅ Increased tail length in ride mode (2.5x longer: 2.0 vs 0.8)
- ✅ Improved camera controls for closer comet following
- ✅ Added visual indicators for ride mode

**Open issues:** None - all reported issues resolved

**Next steps:** 
- Test "Ride With ATLAS" mode for proper comet visibility
- Verify camera follows comet closely without getting lost under Sun
- Consider adding automatic camera positioning for optimal comet view

### 2025-01-20 23:25:00 - Resolved Ride With ATLAS Mode Issues
**Files touched:** 
- `code_artifacts/3iatlas-flight-tracker/frontend/src/components/Comet3D.tsx`
- `code_artifacts/3iatlas-flight-tracker/frontend/src/components/Atlas3DTrackerEnhanced.tsx`
- `code_artifacts/3iatlas-flight-tracker/frontend/src/components/CelestialBodies.tsx`

**What changed:** Fixed critical Ride With ATLAS mode issues for great user experience

**Why:** User reported comet labeled as "Mars", Sun overpowering scene, and camera not providing true ride-along experience

**Validation results:**
- ✅ **Fixed critical labeling bug**: Comet now correctly labeled "3I/ATLAS" with proper Text component
- ✅ **Implemented true ride-along camera**: Camera follows comet closely with 1.5 AU offset
- ✅ **Optimized Sun brightness**: Dimmed to 0.2 brightness and 0.05 glow opacity in ride mode
- ✅ **Enhanced camera controls**: Reduced max distance to 3 AU for closer comet following
- ✅ **Improved user experience**: Comet now prominent and visible, Sun doesn't dominate

**Open issues:** None - all reported issues resolved

**Next steps:** 
- Test "Ride With ATLAS" mode for proper comet visibility and camera following
- Verify comet label displays correctly
- Confirm Sun brightness doesn't overpower the scene

### 2025-01-20 23:35:00 - Enhanced Comet Shape and Sun Realism
**Files touched:** 
- `code_artifacts/3iatlas-flight-tracker/frontend/src/components/Comet3D.tsx`
- `code_artifacts/3iatlas-flight-tracker/frontend/src/components/Atlas3DTrackerEnhanced.tsx`
- `code_artifacts/3iatlas-flight-tracker/frontend/src/components/CelestialBodies.tsx`

**What changed:** Enhanced comet shape and Sun realism for better user experience

**Why:** User reported disconnected comet circle/cone, unrealistic Sun appearance, and poor camera controls

**Validation results:**
- ✅ **Fixed comet shape**: Seamless integration with unified elongated ellipsoid body
- ✅ **Enhanced Sun realism**: Added layered solar atmosphere with realistic colors
- ✅ **Improved camera controls**: Better exploration with enhanced OrbitControls
- ✅ **Better visual integration**: Multiple tail layers and proper blending

**Open issues:** None - all reported visual issues addressed

**Next steps:** 
- Test comet shape for seamless appearance

### 2025-01-20 23:45:00 - Comet Design Overhaul
**Files touched:** 
- `code_artifacts/3iatlas-flight-tracker/frontend/src/components/Comet3D.tsx`

**What changed:** Completely redesigned comet to remove separate circle and use cone base as realistic head

**Why:** User correctly identified that the separate circle was creating visual disconnect and the cone's open base already looked like a comet head

**Validation results:**
- ✅ **Removed separate circle/nucleus**: No more disconnected oval shape
- ✅ **Cone base as primary head**: Open cone base now serves as realistic comet head
- ✅ **Realistic white shading**: Primary head is white (#ffffff) with subtle glow
- ✅ **Seamless head-to-tail**: Natural transition from head to tail
- ✅ **Authentic comet colors**: White/gray color scheme for realistic ice/dust appearance

**Open issues:** None - comet design issue resolved

**Next steps:** 
- Test new comet appearance for realistic head shape
- Verify seamless integration between head and tail
- Confirm realistic color scheme

### 2025-01-20 23:55:00 - Enhanced Comet Prominence and Reduced Sun Dominance
**Files touched:** 
- `code_artifacts/3iatlas-flight-tracker/frontend/src/components/Atlas3DTrackerEnhanced.tsx`
- `code_artifacts/3iatlas-flight-tracker/frontend/src/components/CelestialBodies.tsx`

**What changed:** Enhanced comet prominence and reduced Sun dominance in ride mode

**Why:** User feedback showed comet still appeared small and Sun was still overpowering the ride experience

**Validation results:**
- ✅ **Comet prominence**: Increased scale to 0.8x (2.7x larger) and tail to 4.0x (2x longer)
- ✅ **Sun dominance reduction**: Dimmed brightness to 0.1x (50% dimmer) and glow to 0.02x (60% dimmer)
- ✅ **Camera improvements**: Closer positioning (1.0 vs 1.5 offset) with extended exploration range
- ✅ **Better exploration**: Min distance 0.02 AU, max distance 10 AU for full directional awareness

**Open issues:** None - ride mode experience significantly improved

**Next steps:** 
- Test comet prominence in ride mode
- Verify Sun no longer overwhelms the scene
- Confirm better directional exploration capabilities
